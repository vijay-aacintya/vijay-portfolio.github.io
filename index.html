			<h4>Top 10 Facilities with Highest Amount of Patient Visits</h4>
            <div class="project-description">
                <div class="description-text">
                    <p>
						<B>Key Observations:</b>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Consistent Growth Over the Years:</strong> From 2020 through 2023, these facilities have seen a steady increase in patient visits, reflecting a growing demand for healthcare services in the DFW Metro Area.</li>
								<li><strong>Dominance of Major Centers:</strong> ZEBRA MAIN MEDICAL CENTER and TRFM DALLAS lead the chart, indicating these are primary healthcare hubs within the region. Their high patient volumes necessitate robust resource management and possibly expansions to meet the increasing demand.</li>
								<li><strong>Telehealth Adoption:</strong> The significant number of visits to RCPC TELEHEALTH and ZEBRA TELEHEALTH facilities highlights the growing acceptance and reliance on remote healthcare services. This trend might have been accelerated by the pandemic and continues to be a viable option for many patients.</li>
								<li><strong>Notable Increase in RCPC Facilities:</strong> Multiple RCPC facilities are among the top 10, suggesting that the RCPC network is a crucial player in the regionâ€™s healthcare delivery.</li>
							</ul>
						
						  <b>Insights:</b>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Focused Resource Allocation:</strong> Facilities like ZEBRA MAIN MEDICAL CENTER and TRFM DALLAS may require additional staffing and resources to handle the high volume of patient visits efficiently.</li>
								<li><strong>Enhanced Telehealth Services:</strong> With significant usage of telehealth services, continued investment in improving digital healthcare infrastructure could enhance patient experiences and access to care.</li>
								<li><strong>Targeted Safety Measures:</strong> Given the steady rise in patient visits, especially in facilities like RCPC CLEBURNE and RCPC LAS CALINUS, targeted safety measures and infrastructure improvements could help manage the growing traffic and ensure quality care.</li>

			<h4>No Shows Totals by Each Weekday</h4>
            <div class="project-description">
                <div class="description-text">
                    <p>
						<B>Key Observations:</B>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Highest No-Shows on Tuesday:</strong> With 267 no-shows, Tuesday has the highest occurrence, indicating potential issues with patient availability or scheduling on this day.</li>
							<li><strong>Consistently High on Thursday:</strong> Thursday follows closely with 251 no-shows, suggesting it also faces similar scheduling challenges.</li>
							<li><strong>Lower No-Shows on Monday:</strong> Monday has the fewest no-shows at 115, which could indicate better patient adherence to appointments or fewer scheduled appointments.</li>
							<li><strong>Mid-Week Variation:</strong> Wednesday and Friday have moderate no-show rates, showing a varied pattern of patient attendance through the mid-week period.</li>
						</ul>
						<B>Insights:</B>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Potential Causes:</strong> The high no-show rates on Tuesday and Thursday could be due to mid-week fatigue, conflicting personal schedules, or other external factors. Understanding these causes can help in creating better appointment reminders or alternative scheduling options.</li>
							<li><strong>Actionable Strategies:</strong> Implementing reminder systems, rescheduling policies, and possibly offering incentives for attending appointments on high no-show days (Tuesday and Thursday) could help reduce these numbers.</li>
							<li><strong>Monday as a Strategic Day:</strong> With lower no-shows on Monday, this day could be strategically used for scheduling critical or follow-up appointments, ensuring higher patient attendance and optimal resource utilization.</li>

			<h4>Top 10 Payers</h4>
            <div class="project-description">
                <div class="description-text">
                    <p>
						<B>Key Observations:</B>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dominance of Self-Pay:</strong> Self-Pay leads significantly with 22.01% of appointments, indicating a large portion of patients prefer or are required to pay out-of-pocket for services.</li>
                <li><strong>Prominent Role of MEDICARE PART B:</strong> With 13.83%, MEDICARE PART B is the second highest, showing its importance for the patient population, likely serving a considerable elderly demographic.</li>
                <li><strong>BCBS TX:</strong> As the third highest at 12.74%, BCBS TX is a major insurer for this patient group, indicating strong market penetration in the region.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Insurance Types:</strong> The remaining insurance types, from MEDICAL MANAGEMENT to UHC, collectively cover a wide range of patients, though each represents a smaller percentage individually.</li>
            </ul>
            <B>Insights:</B>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insurance Utilization Trends:</strong> The data reflects significant reliance on Self-Pay and major insurance providers like MEDICARE PART B and BCBS TX. This might be due to the specific demographics and economic conditions of the patient population.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential for Financial Planning:</strong> The high percentage of Self-Pay patients suggests the need for financial planning services or payment options to support patients who may face difficulties with out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Insurance Partnerships:</strong> Providers might consider strengthening partnerships with top insurers like BCBS TX and MEDICARE PART B to streamline services and potentially negotiate better terms for patients.</li>
            </ul>
            <B>Strategic Considerations:</B>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Support for Self-Pay Patients:</strong> Offering flexible payment plans or financial counseling could help manage the high percentage of Self-Pay appointments and improve patient satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Elderly Care:</strong> With a significant portion of appointments under MEDICARE PART B, targeting services for elderly care, including specialized programs or outreach, could better serve this demographic.</li>
                <li><strong>Broad Insurance Acceptance:</strong> Maintaining or expanding acceptance of diverse insurance providers ensures coverage for a wide patient base, enhancing accessibility to healthcare services.</li>

			<div class="project-description">
				<div class="description-text">
					<p>
						This project reads all the PDFs in the data folder, creates a vectorstore, and enables interaction with the content of these PDFs. You can add PDFs with any type of content and use the chat feature to ask questions and receive answers.<br><br>
						As a case study, I downloaded all the PDFs from the Microsoft Licensing Program and processed them so that I could use the chatbot to query and get my answers. Understanding and complying with Microsoft Licensing Agreements can be quite challenging, often requiring an advanced understanding of complex terms. To help with this, I included PDF agreements from various Microsoft licensing programs. Using this chatbot has been a humorous yet effective way to grasp these agreements and get quicker answers.<br><br>
						However, I encountered some limitations. There were too many PDFs, and the free version of Groq restricted the number of tokens processed per minute and the size of the chunks. Consequently, I had to significantly reduce the number of files for processing. For this project, I used only three files from the website Microsoft Licensing Programs. If you can afford to increase your limits, you could potentially query the entire set of agreements using this tool.

                    <p>In a recent exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, I examined motor vehicle accident data from data.gov to uncover patterns and 
						trends within New York City's five boroughs. The dataset, comprising over 2 million records spanning the last 10 years, was filtered 
						to focus on data from 2020 to 2023. Through comprehensive analysis, I identified several critical insights, highlighting the factors contributing to 
						these accidents. The exercise revealed the frequency and distribution of accidents across different areas and pinpointed key variables like time of day, 
						weather conditions, and high-risk locations. These findings are crucial for developing targeted strategies to improve road safety and reduce accident rates 
						in New York City. The project primarily involved EDA and NULL value treatment to ensure data quality.

            <p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Steady Increase in Accidents and Fatalities:</strong>
						<p>The data shows a consistent increase in both accidents and fatalities across most boroughs from 2020 to 2023. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Bronx and Queens.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Highest Numbers in New York City:</strong>
						<p>New York City and its boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens see the highest numbers of both accidents and fatalities. This aligns with their larger populations and higher traffic densities.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Significant Issues in Bronx and Queens:</strong>
						<p>The Bronx has shown a significant increase in both accidents and fatalities, indicating a growing concern. Similarly, Queens has also seen a noticeable rise, especially in the last two years.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Lower Rates in Staten Island:</strong>
						<p>Staten Island consistently shows the lowest numbers in both accidents and fatalities, which could be attributed to its lower population density and less busy roads.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

							<p>The image presents a combination of a boxplot and a histogram for the "CLM_PMT_AMT" (Claim Payment Amount) variable from a dataset. Here are the key observations:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Right-Skewed Distribution</strong>: The claim payment amounts are right-skewed, meaning there are more small payments with a few very large payments, creating a long tail towards higher values.</li>
							<li><strong>Outliers</strong>: Several outliers are present, as highlighted by the dots above the whiskers in the boxplot.</li>
							<li><strong>Average Payment</strong>: The average payment amount is around $9,573.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This kind of distribution is common in financial datasets where a small number of claims can be substantially larger than the majority. These insights can help in understanding 
							the payment patterns and identifying potential areas for further investigation or adjustment in claims processing strategies.</p>

                <div class="description-text">
					<p>The image shows a residual plot for a LightGBM Regressor model. Residual plots help us evaluate the performance of our model by showing the differences between observed and predicted values (residuals) on both the training and test datasets. Let's break down the key observations:</p>
					<b>Key Elements:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Title</strong>: Residuals for LGBMRegressor Model.</li>
						<li><strong>Residuals Displayed</strong>: Two sets of residualsâ€”one for the training data (in blue) and one for the test data (in green).</li>
						<li><strong>RÂ² Values</strong>:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Train RÂ² = 0.480</strong>: Indicates that 48% of the variability in the training data is explained by the model.</li>
								<li><strong>Test RÂ² = 0.180</strong>: Indicates that only 18% of the variability in the test data is explained by the model.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Axes</strong>:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>x-axis</strong>: Predicted values (ranging from 0 to 70).</li>
								<li><strong>y-axis</strong>: Residuals (ranging from -125 to 50).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Observations:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Right-Skewed Residuals</strong>: The distribution of residuals appears to be right-skewed, which might indicate that our model struggles with higher predicted values.</li>
						<li><strong>Test vs. Train Performance</strong>: The much lower RÂ² value for the test data compared to the training data suggests that the model may not generalize well to unseen data, potentially overfitting the training data.</li>
						<li><strong>Clusters of Residuals</strong>: There's a noticeable pattern or cluster of residuals, particularly around the lower predicted values, which could indicate some systematic error or bias in the model.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Insights:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Generalization Issue</strong>: The model's performance on the test set is significantly lower than on the training set, indicating a need for model tuning, feature engineering, or even trying a different model.</li>
						<li><strong>Residual Distribution</strong>: Understanding the residual distribution can help in refining the model to handle outliers and extreme values more effectively.</li>

					<b>Insights:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Top Features</strong>: <code>CLM_PMT_AMT</code>, <code>Month_Year</code>, and <code>CLM_DRG_CD</code> are the top three features, indicating they have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.</li>
						<li><strong>Least Important Features</strong>: <code>PROVIDER</code>, <code>CLM_PASS_THRU_PER_DIEM_AMT</code>, and <code>NCH_BENE_PTA_COINSRNC_LBLTY_AM</code> have the least importance, suggesting they contribute minimally to the model's decisions.</li>

					<p>
						Looking at the learning curve for the LGBMRegressor, there's quite a gap between the training and cross-validation scores. 
						This suggests that the model fits the training data well but struggles with generalizing to new, unseen data. 
						This discrepancy is a classic sign of high variance in your dataset, meaning the model might be overfitting. Something to consider for improving its generalization.

					<p>
						<p>This graph is a validation curve for an LGBMRegressor, plotting the training score and cross-validation score against the <code>max_depth</code> parameter.</p>
        <b>Key Insights:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Score</strong>: As <code>max_depth</code> increases, the training score improves, indicating the model fits the training data better with deeper trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Validation Score</strong>: Initially, this also improves with <code>max_depth</code>, but after a certain point, it plateaus and slightly decreases, suggesting deeper trees donâ€™t always help and can lead to overfitting.</li>
            <li><strong>Overfitting</strong>: The widening gap between the training and cross-validation scores at higher <code>max_depth</code> levels suggests overfittingâ€”your model is too tuned to the training data and struggles with new data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, while increasing <code>max_depth</code> might seem like a good idea at first, there's a point where it starts to harm your modelâ€™s ability to generalize. Aim for the sweet spot where the cross-validation score is highest to balance bias and variance!</p>

					<p>
						<b>Conclusions:</b>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Claim Payment Patterns:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Right-Skewed Distribution:</strong> Claim payment amounts are generally small, with a few high-value outliers.</li>
									<li><strong>Significant Outliers:</strong> There are notable outliers in the data, which could affect the overall analysis and should be handled with care.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Claim Utilization Days:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Common Durations:</strong> Shorter claim durations (1-3 days) are more frequent.</li>
									<li><strong>High-Value Claims:</strong> For claims over $22,000, a significant number are processed within 3-7 days.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Primary and Admitting Diagnoses:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Frequent Diagnoses:</strong> Conditions like pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and shortness of breath are common reasons for hospital admission.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Model Performance:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> The model shows signs of overfitting, as indicated by the widening gap between training and test scores at higher max_depth levels.</li>
									<li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> Features such as claim payment amount, date-related information, and DRG codes significantly impact the modelâ€™s predictions.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					
						<b>Recommendations:</b>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Handle Outliers:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Apply techniques like log transformation or robust scaling to handle the right-skewed distribution and outliers in claim payment amounts.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Model Tuning:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Regularization:</strong> Use regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.</li>
									<li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Create new features or transform existing ones to capture more information and improve model performance.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Data Analysis and Visualization:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Interactive Visualizations:</strong> Develop interactive dashboards to explore the data and communicate insights effectively.</li>
									<li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Regularly perform trend analysis to monitor changes in claim patterns and diagnose reasons for hospital admission.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Prioritize Conditions:</strong> Focus on frequently occurring conditions like pneumonia and heart failure to optimize resource allocation and improve patient outcomes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These steps will help improve the accuracy and robustness of the model, enhance the understanding of claim data patterns, and support better decision-making in the healthcare claims process.</p>
